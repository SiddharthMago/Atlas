## File Overview:
1. atlas.ipynb - main jupyter notebook with all task related codes.
2. observations.ipynb - jupyter notebook with all visualisation and extra codes used to make inferences on the graphs.
3. AtlasBONUS.ipynb - jupyter notebook with only BONUS task.

## To Run:
1. Use requirements.txt to make a virtual environment. (optional)
2. Run the first code box of each jupyter notebook and then restart kernel with run all.
3. AtlasBONUS was made in colab.research.google.com while atlas.ipynb and observations.ipynb were made on local machine.
4. Interactive graphs are visualised in html files that must be opened using live server.

## External Resources:
#### This project utilized ChatGPT to refine grammar, enhance professionalism in written responses, and summarize content. ChatGPT was employed as a language processing tool to improve clarity and coherence in the final outputs. It was also used to debug syntactic errors in code and help with library/module version control.
