# üåç A-T-L-A-S: Graph Theory Meets the Game of Geography

> "India" ‚ûú "Australia" ‚ûú "Austria" ‚ûú "Albania"... can you trap your opponent using the power of graph theory?

This project reimagines the classic word game **ATLAS** as a directed graph problem. We explore how concepts from **graph theory**, **community detection**, and **machine learning** can provide strategies and predictive insight into the game using real-world datasets of countries and cities.

<br>

## üìò Project Summary

- Constructed 3 ATLAS-style graphs:
  1. Country Only
  2. City Only (top 500 by population)
  3. Country + City Combined
- Analyzed key properties using NetworkX to uncover gameplay strategies
- Performed **community detection** using Louvain and Girvan‚ÄìNewman algorithms
- Built a **link prediction model** using Node2Vec and GNNs to anticipate valid transitions
- Created visualizations and strategic insights based on node connectivity

## üóÇÔ∏è File Overview

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `atlas.ipynb` | Main notebook with graph creation, EDA, and strategy logic |
| `observations.ipynb` | Visualizations and exploratory insights |
| `AtlasBONUS.ipynb` | BONUS: Link prediction with Node2Vec & GNN |
| `observations.pptx` | Strategic insights in presentation format |
| `precog.pptx` | Final presentation for submission |

<br>

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open each notebook in Jupyter or Colab:
   - Run the first code cell  
   - Restart the kernel  
   - Run all cells again  
3. `AtlasBONUS.ipynb` was developed on **Colab**; others were built locally.  
4. Some interactive graphs are exported as `.html` and should be opened using **Live Server** in VSCode or a local browser.

<br>

## üìà Graph Analysis & Strategy

We used 6 graph theory concepts to extract insights from gameplay:

- Degree & Out-degree centrality  
- PageRank  
- Strongly Connected Components  
- Diameter & Density  
- Terminal nodes (Dead Ends)  
- Clustering coefficient  

These were evaluated across all 3 graphs to understand how the game evolves with dataset complexity.

<br>

## üîé Community Detection

- **Algorithms**: Louvain, Girvan‚ÄìNewman  
- **Evaluated via**: Modularity score  
- Communities showed alignment with geographic and linguistic groupings  
- **Strategic insight**: Jumping across communities can isolate opponents

| Features     | Start & end characters, character embeddings           |
| Training     | Unsupervised on masked edges                           |
| Objective    | Predict future transitions in gameplay                 |
